  "description": "Augusta University uses the [modern campus product](https://moderncampus.com/) for [their catalog](https://catalog.augusta.edu/). In addition to being hard to navigate, this platform is poorly accessible, since the courses' description, pre-requisites, etc., are accessible only after clicking on some elements (triggering some javascript function)."
